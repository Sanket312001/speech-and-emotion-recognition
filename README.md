🚀 Exciting Project Alert: Emotion Detection & Speech Recognition System! 🎙️😊

I'm thrilled to share my latest project—an AI-powered Emotion Detection and Speech Recognition System built using Python, TensorFlow, and Whisper! 🚀

🔹 What It Does:
Converts M4A to WAV for seamless audio processing

Detects Emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.) from speech using LSTM deep learning

Transcribes Speech to Text using OpenAI's Whisper for accurate results

Works in real-time for uploaded audio files

🔹 Tech Stack:
Python (Librosa, TensorFlow, PyDub)

Machine Learning (LSTM for emotion classification)

Speech Recognition (Whisper for transcription)

Google Colab for cloud-based execution

🔹 Key Learnings:
✔️ Audio signal processing & feature extraction (MFCCs, pitch, energy)
✔️ Building & training deep learning models for emotion classification
✔️ Integrating speech-to-text with AI emotion detection

This project was a fantastic dive into AI, speech processing, and real-time analysis—perfect for applications in customer service, mental health tech, and voice assistants!
